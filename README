** About

This repository contains:

- My configuration files (aka "dot-files") for various programs.  But
  not all: several "big" (usually programmable) configs (for guix,
  emacs, stumpwm, etc.) live in their own repositories (they may be
  found in [[https://gitlab.com/alezost-config]] group).

- A tool (=config.scm= Guile script) to deal with my configs.

** config.scm

So to deploy my config files, appropriate symlinks are being created
(for example, =~/.bashrc= is becoming a symlink to =bash/bashrc= from
this repo).  For this purpose (and for other useful actions, like
listing available configs or removing old configuration files), I use
=config.scm= script from this repo.  It relies on my [[https://gitlab.com/alezost/guile-modules][guile modules]].

*** Examples

=config.scm= deploys (symlinks) itself to =~/bin/config= and as [[~/bin]]
directory is in my PATH, I can refer to it as =config=.  Although it
provides "-h"/"--help" option, here are some examples anyway:

- Clone all repositories with my configs to appropriate places and make
  the required symlinks:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  config --fetch --deploy
  #+END_SRC

- Display a list of names of all available configurations:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  config -l
  #+END_SRC

- Show verbose descriptions (git repositories, directories where they
  will cloned and symlinks that will be created during deploying) of
  "emacs" and "shepherd" configurations:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  config --show emacs shepherd
  #+END_SRC

** Bootstrapping

After installing a new operating system, my first wish is to have all my
configs deployed!  So I just clone this repo and run =bootstrap= shell
script which does the job for me (it downloads my guile modules and
executes =config.scm= using them).  There is also =help= shell script to
remind me the details of bootstrapping process on a fresh system.
