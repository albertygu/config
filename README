This repository contains my configuration files (aka "dot-files") for
various programs.  But not all: several "big" (usually programmable)
configs (for emacs, stumpwm, conkeror, etc.) live in their own
repositories (they may be found in [[https://gitlab.com/alezost-config]]
group).

To deploy these config files, appropriate symlinks are being created
(for example, =~/.bashrc= is becoming a symlink to =bash/bashrc= from
this repo).  For this purpose (and for other useful actions, like
listing available configs or removing old configuration files), I use
=config.scm= script from this repo.  It relies on some of my
[[https://gitlab.com/alezost/guile-modules]].
