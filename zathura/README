[[file:zathurarc]] includes =theme= file (git-ignored) which is just a
symlink to [[file:dark-theme][file:light-theme]] or [[file:dark-theme][file:dark-theme]].  This =theme= file may
be easily "re-linked", for example by a shell script, so I can switch
between the dark and the light themes without modifying zathura config.

Actually since I start Zathura only from Emacs, instead of a shell
script I use some elisp code to synchronize my zathura theme with the
current emacs theme before Zathura is started.  The relevant code is
placed [[https://gitlab.com/alezost-emacs/config/blob/master/settings.el][here]] (search for "zathura" there) and [[https://gitlab.com/alezost-emacs/utils/blob/master/utl-process.el][here]].
